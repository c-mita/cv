## CV
Repo to LaTeX to generate my CV and produce a PDF.

The contact details and address given in `example.pdf` are not real and should not be used.

### Build
* Create a sed script in `subs` to perform the substitutions required for the contact details (e.g. called `real.sed`).
* Run `make real`.
* Output `real.pdf` will be in `build`.
